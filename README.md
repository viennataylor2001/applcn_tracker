📊 The Ultimate App & Website Usage Tracker: The Most Boring App You'll Ever Use! 🕵️‍♂️
Welcome to the Ultimate App & Website Usage Tracker! You’ve just stumbled upon the greatest tool for tracking how many hours you spend doom-scrolling through social media, binge-watching cat videos, or just pretending to be productive. If you've ever wondered how much of your life you've spent on a particular app or website, wonder no more!
